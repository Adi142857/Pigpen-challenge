# Pigpen-challenge- Below given are substitution ciphers that do not just use letters or numbers. Some, such as the pigpen cipher, use symbols. Here is our message I AM A CODEBREAKER written using the pigpen cipher:  If we closely observe the pigpen cipher looks unintelligible, it is actually a fairly basic form of the substitution cipher. The letters of the alphabet are written out on 4 grids.   #### The below image can make your understanding more clear  Inorder to find out the cryptographical  code, take the portion of the grid in which the letter you require is written. This then becomes your code! That's it waiting for your cooks!
